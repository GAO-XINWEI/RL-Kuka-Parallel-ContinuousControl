# RL-Kuka-Parallel-ContinuousControl
This is a pybullet KUKA manupulator continuous control code base. Based on PPO, AC. Parallel training.
## Detial
1. RGB image input.
2. Constrained trajectory on z-axis movement.
3. Action space: x-axis movement, y-axis movement,Z-axis rotation.
## Advantage
1. Fully in continous control space.
2. Used parallel to solve the pybullet slow running problem.
## Requirement
1. pytotch
2. pybullet
3. matplotlib
4. numpy
